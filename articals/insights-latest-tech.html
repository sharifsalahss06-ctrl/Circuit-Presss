      <p><strong>By Maya</strong><br>
      <em>October 30, 2025</em></p>

      <p>"It's in the cloud." We hear it all the time. Your photos, your documents, your music... it's all just *in the cloud*. It sounds like magic, but it's one of the most misunderstood (and most important) concepts in modern tech. As a dev student, I had to get my head around this, and the insight I found was that the cloud isn't a *place*, it's a *business model*.</p>
      
      <p>At its simplest: **"The cloud" is just someone else's computer.**</p>
      
      <p>That's it. Instead of you owning and managing a powerful server in your room (which is expensive, hot, and needs 24/7 maintenance), you're just *renting* a small slice of a massive, warehouse-sized computer owned by a giant corporation.</p>

      <h2>The 'Big Three' Players</h2>

      <p>When people talk about the cloud in a business or tech context, they're almost always talking about one of three companies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS):</strong> The undisputed king. Amazon started this whole thing. They had so much excess computing power from running their online store that they decided to rent it out.</li>
        <li><strong>Microsoft Azure:</strong> The giant from Microsoft. They are hugely popular with big corporations that already use Windows servers and other Microsoft products.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Cloud Platform (GCP):</strong> The same infrastructure that powers Google Search and YouTube. They're known for being super-strong in AI, Machine Learning, and data analytics.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>These companies don't just rent out storage. They rent out *everything*: virtual servers (called 'EC2' in AWS), databases ('RDS'), networking, AI models, and hundreds of other services. But this still doesn't explain *why* it's such a big deal.</p>

      <h2>The Real Insight: CapEx vs. OpEx</h2>

      <p>This is the part that changed my perspective. The cloud's real innovation was changing the *economics* of running a tech company.</p>
      
      <h3>The Old Way: CapEx (Capital Expenditure)</h3>
      <p>Imagine it's 2005 and you have a great idea for a new website. Before you can write a single line of code, you have to spend **tens of thousands of dollars** buying physical servers, hard drives, and networking gear. You have to put them in a cold room (a data center) and hope you bought enough. If your site suddenly gets popular? It crashes. If it's not popular? You just wasted all that money on hardware that's now collecting dust. This is **CapEx**: a huge, risky, upfront cost.</p>
      
      <h3>The New Way: OpEx (Operational Expenditure)</h3>
      <p>Now, it's 2025. You have the same great idea. You sign up for an AWS account (for free), spin up a virtual server for $5 a month, and launch your site in an afternoon. If your site gets popular, you just click a button to "auto-scale," and AWS instantly provides more power. You only pay for what you use, just like your electricity bill. This is **OpEx**: a low, predictable, pay-as-you-go cost.</p>

      <h2>Why This Is the Most Important Insight</h2>
      
      <p>The shift from CapEx to OpEx is the single biggest reason we've had such an explosion of tech startups in the last 15 years. You no longer need to be a millionaire to build the next big thing. You can be a student in a dorm room (like us!) and have access to the *exact same* world-class, supercomputing infrastructure as a global bank. You can "rent a superpower" for the price of a coffee.</p>
      
      <p>That's the real insight. The cloud isn't just a place to store your files. It's the economic engine that leveled the playing field and made the modern tech industry possible.</p>
